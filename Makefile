# vgi-match — dev and test targets.
#
# Usage:
#   make test       # unit/integration (pytest) + end-to-end SQL (haybarn-unittest)
#   make test-unit  # pytest only
#   make test-sql   # DuckDB sqllogictest .test files via haybarn-unittest
#
# test-sql is self-contained: it points VGI_MATCH_WORKER at the worker run as a
# uv stdio subprocess (exactly how DuckDB drives it after ATTACH) and runs the
# files under test/sql/. haybarn-unittest is a uv tool:
#   uv tool install haybarn-unittest   # installs ~/.local/bin/haybarn-unittest

# Worker command DuckDB uses for ATTACH (overridable). Use the installed console
# script in the project venv (the same LOCATION CI uses) rather than
# `uv run match_worker.py`: a PEP-723 script env caches its own SDK copy, which
# can drift from the synced project venv and attach against a stale schema.

# haybarn-unittest lives in the uv tools bin; keep it on PATH.
